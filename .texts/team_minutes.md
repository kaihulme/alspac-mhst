Two seperated data-imputation teams are working parallel and Fu's team was stucked at the stage, waiting for Kai's result come out later.

At this stage what we've mainly coverd is to find the correlation of our data via xgboost imputation. The up-to-date dataset is located in the file of `/data/altered/imputed/maps_xgboost_impute.csv`

Results arent very interesting at the stage yet.

Monty were catching up on the write up. For Kai's bit, what we are going to do is the dimensionality reduction. Instead of doing PCA which can't explain the relations between features we can choose other techniques.

I think analysing the classification performance on some different feature sets and looking at how feature importance changes. Should also run a grid search on the classifier beforehand. Then we should do some statistical analysis and visualisations of the features which we found important that also relate to our research goal

Kai: But I'm thinking we use the classification as a way to guide us to an analysis due to the large number of features, rather than it just being an ML project.
